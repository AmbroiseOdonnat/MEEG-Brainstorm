## Data

## Recover code
Clone this github repository by running in terminal `git clone https://github.com/AmbroiseOdonnat/MEEG-Brainstorm.git`.  

## Virtual environment setup

First, make sure that a compatible version of Python 3 is installed on your system by running in terminal: `python3 --version`.  
It requires Python >= 3.6 and <3.10.  

With X being your python3 version, create virtual environment by running in terminal: `python3.X -m venv transformer_env`.   

Activate transformer_env by running in terminal: `source transformer_env/bin/activate`.  

Go to repository location. Install the requirements by running in terminal: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
