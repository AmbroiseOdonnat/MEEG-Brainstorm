# MEEG-Brainstorm

Repository for training MEEG datasets with the [ivadomed](https://ivadomed.org) framework in Brainstorm.

For this project, we are using a development version of Brainstorm (LINK TO ADD).

A collection of ivadomed's config.json files will be listed here for different training approaches. Discussions about training strategies will happen:
- In this [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PLo__1w8K5Zk1c8ckOLamadaGM_dK872cYwsGFO4DQk/edit#)
- In NeuroPoly/NeuroSPEED slack channel (internal to the dev team)
- In this repository as new [issues](https://github.com/ivadomed/MEEG-Brainstorm/issues).

## Extraction of data using Brainstorm

- Set the sampling rate using downsampling (eg 100 Hz, the original sampling being 2400Hz).
TODO: continue this bullet point

## Definitions

- Trial: Exerpt from an entire recording of an EEG and/or MEG experiment, across channels. Eg: (64 ch, 200 samples)
